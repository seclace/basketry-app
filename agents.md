# AGENTS

Basic instructions for agents:

- Follow the user request and prioritize correctness.
- Ask a brief clarification when requirements are ambiguous.
- Prefer reading existing files and conventions before changing anything.
- Read project configs before making changes.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; do not revert unrelated work.
- Avoid destructive commands unless explicitly requested.
- Document changes briefly and suggest next steps if useful.
- Always respond in Russian.
- Use a neutral tone.
- Align on a plan with the user before starting substantive work.
- Run tests and linters when applicable.
- Add comments only when needed (e.g., a complex block longer than ~20 lines).
